            <h2>REVIEW</h2>
            <p><em>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</em> is the first movie in the legendary <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy. The movie is about a party of adventurers
                that are seeking to destroy a ring that has the potential for great evil, and corruption. Tolkien's fictional world has infulenced the way modern day fantasy is percieved
                with his writing being used as inspiration for many other fantasy settings. It's a must watch/read that has stood the test of time and fully immerses you into it's engaging story.
                <br><br>
                This movie feels like a labor of love, everyone was in tune with each other. The Director, Actors, Effects Team, and the Musicians made this brilliant film that stands the test
                of time and can stand amongst titles 20 years later. <em>Lord of the Rings</em> is a must watch for any fan of fantasy  with it's masterful world building and set pieces that will
                leave you wanting more. <b>- Zachary Bowen 2/12/2022</b>

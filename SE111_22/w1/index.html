    <h1>Zachary Bowen</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am a student currently attending <b>New England Tech</b> pursuing a <i>Software Engineering Degree</i>. I am working on my <u>associates in IT</u> first.<br>
       I like to play a number of table top games in my free time, and listen to music and play video games I also enjoy creative writing. I lived in Rhode Island <br>
       for most of my life, and would like to see a world a bit more one day. I am excited to learn about programming and I always had an interest in it.</p>
